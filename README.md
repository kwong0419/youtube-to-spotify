Download from the chrome web store [here!]()

Thanks for checking our Youtube to Spotify Extension. This Chrome extension lets users add music from YouTube to their Spotify playlist. It can only be launched when on a YouTube page. When launched the Chrome extension will look for a matching song and display options to the user.

You can always redo a search if there was a mistake, quick and easy!
Users can select what playlist they would like to add the song to. There is a success message when the song has been added! Relaunch on a new song.
